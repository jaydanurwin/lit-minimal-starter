# Lit Minimal Starter

This repo is a simple starter for creating a web app and/or a website with [Lit.dev](https://lit.dev)

It is designed to be as minimal as possible but still has the dependencies needed to serve and deploy successfully.

The main branch is Javascript but if you prefer to use Typescript there is a branch ready to go for you

## Instructions for use:

### Install Dependencies

```
npm i
```

### Serve the project locally

```
npm run dev
```

### Build static files for deployment

```
npm run build
```
